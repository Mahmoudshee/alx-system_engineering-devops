# Postmortem: Server Connectivity Outage Incident

## Issue Summary
- Duration: The project over - took place from Apr 18, 2023, 3:00 AM to Apr 19, 2023, 3:00 AM.
- Impact: Our servers decided to take an unscheduled nap during this time, resulting in a complete unavailability of our web service. Users were greeted with a frustrating error message and had a 100% chance of winning the "Can't Connect to Servers" lottery.
- Root Cause: Turns out, our network firewall rules got a little too carried away with their job and started blocking incoming connections. They needed a gentle reminder that we want users to visit our servers, not avoid them like the plague.

## Timeline
- April 18, 2023, 3:00 AM: While most people were still peacefully asleep, our vigilant users reported being unable to connect to the servers. Kudos to them for being early birds!
- April 18, 2023, 3:05 AM: Our groggy operations team rose to the occasion and started investigating potential network connectivity issues. They were armed with coffee and determination.
- April 18, 2023, 3:15 AM: Network connectivity tests played hard to get and showed no signs of issues. It was time to go Sherlock Holmes on the firewall configuration.
- April 18, 2023, 3:30 AM: After analyzing firewall logs, we uncovered the culprit - a misconfigured rule that thought blocking incoming connections was the latest trend in network security fashion. It was time to teach it some manners.
- April 18, 2023, 3:45 AM: The incident was escalated to our network security team, who were experts at dealing with rebellious firewall rules. They put on their wizard hats and started conjuring a solution.
- April 18, 2023, 4:15 AM: With their magic spells and debugging skills, the network security team revealed that the misconfigured rule was the ultimate party pooper. It had to be banished!
- April 18, 2023, 4:30 AM: Armed with their trusty keyboards, the network security team swiftly updated the firewall rule, giving it a crash course in hospitality. Incoming connections were now welcomed with open arms!
- April 19, 2023, 3:00 AM: Our servers, feeling refreshed after their beauty sleep, were ready to rock and roll. Full service functionality was restored, and users rejoiced!

## Root Cause and Resolution
- Root Cause: The misconfigured firewall rule, a rebellious troublemaker, decided to block all incoming connections. It had a momentary lapse in judgment and forgot that we actually wanted people to visit our servers. Silly rule!
- Resolution: Our talented network security team saved the day by updating the firewall rule and reminding it of its true purpose - to allow incoming connections. The rule got a stern talking-to and promised to behave from now on.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Improvement Opportunities:
  - Enhance our network monitoring system with a sense of humor, so it can detect and alert us when rules go rogue.
  - Implement a firewall rule fashion police to regularly review and validate configurations for any rebellious tendencies.
  - Conduct team-building exercises for our firewall rules to remind them of their role in fostering connections, not blocking them.

- Task List:
  - Task 1: Inject humor into our network monitoring system, so it can alert us with funny messages when misconfigurations occur.
  - Task 2: Establish regular firewall rule
  - Task 3: Implement periodic audits of firewall rules to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.

## Conclusion
The server connectivity outage that occurred from April 18, 2023, 3:00 AM (UTC) to April 19, 2023, 3:00 AM (UTC) was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked incoming connections. Through prompt investigation and resolution, the root cause was identified and rectified, restoring server connectivity for users. Moving forward, implementing the proposed measures, such as enhancing network monitoring, establishing a configuration review process, and conducting regular audits of firewall rules, will mitigate the risk of similar incidents and ensure stable and uninterrupted service.
